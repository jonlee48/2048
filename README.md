# 2048
One of my favorite games programmed in java with additional features ;)

The game is built entirely in java and uses java Swing for GUI elements

Features include:

- New Game
- Save Game
- Open Game
- Change Board Size (2 by 2 to 8 by 8)

To run program you will need the following files
- GUI.java (main class)
- Board.java
- SaveGames.java
- games2048.txt

The command line version (Console2048.java) uses WASD keyboard input to play a game within the command line. Also allows for changing board size.
